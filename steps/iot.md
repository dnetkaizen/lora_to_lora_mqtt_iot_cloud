The Watson IoT Platform will play multiple roles in this pattern, by taking in the audio and delivering it back, and by sending commands and receiving topics from a hardware device. The published topic will carry out a sentence with it based on a previously sent command. MQTT made it easy to build a communication between the Node-RED, IoT Platform and the device.
